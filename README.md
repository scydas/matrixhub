# MatrixHub

**MatrixHub** is an open-source, self-hosted AI model registry engineered for large-scale enterprise inference. It serves as a drop-in private replacement for Hugging Face, purpose-built to accelerate **vLLM** and **SGLang** workloads.

## 💡 Why MatrixHub?

MatrixHub streamlines the transition from public model hubs to production-grade infrastructure:

* **Zero-Wait Distribution**: Eliminate bandwidth bottlenecks with a **"Pull-once, serve-all"** cache, enabling 10Gbps+ speeds across 100+ GPU nodes simultaneously.
* **Air-Gapped Delivery**: Securely ferry models into isolated networks while maintaining a native `HF_ENDPOINT` experience for researchers—no internet required.
* **Private AI model Registry**: Centralize fine-tuned weights with **Tag locking** and CI/CD integration to guarantee absolute consistency from development to production.
* **Global Multi-Region Sync**: Automate asynchronous, resumable replication between data centers for high availability and low-latency local access.

## 🛠️ Core Features

### 🚀 High-Performance Distribution

* **Transparent HF Proxy**: Switch to private hosting with zero code changes by simply redirecting your endpoint.
* **On-Demand Caching**: Automatically localizes public models upon the first request to slash redundant traffic.
* **Inference Native**: Native support for **P2P distribution**, OCI artifacts, and **NetLoader** for direct-to-GPU weight streaming.

### 🛡️ Enterprise Governance & Security

* **RBAC & Multi-Tenancy**: Project-based isolation with granular permissions and seamless LDAP/SSO integration.
* **Audit & Compliance**: Full traceability with comprehensive logs for every upload, download, and configuration change.
* **Integrity Protection**: Built-in malware scanning and content signing to ensure models remain untampered.

### 🌍 Scalable Infrastructure

* **Storage Agnostic**: Compatible with local file systems, NFS, and S3-compatible backends (MinIO, AWS, etc.).
* **Reliable Replication**: Policy-driven, chunked transfers ensure data consistency even over unstable global networks.
* **Cloud-Native Design**: Optimized for Kubernetes with official **Helm charts** and horizontal scaling capabilities.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Docker Deployment

Deploy MatrixHub with Docker:

```bash
make image-build
docker run -d -p 9527:9527 -v $PWD/data:/data ghcr.io/matrixhub-ai/matrixhub:main
```

Access MatrixHub at `http://localhost:9527`.
